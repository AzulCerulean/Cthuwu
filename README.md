Initially tought of making a tinder-esque recipe sharibng app, but for the lack of time and some issues this is it's current form.

This app uses React js on the front-end, Express js in the back-end and MongoDB as a DB

I tried to limit my use of packages as we were supposed to build things from the ground up.
