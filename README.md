## About

This is my final project submission for the Concordia full-stack web-dev bootcamp.

Recipe sharing web-app.

Users are able to sign-up and post recipes on the feed.
Social media for sharing, discovering and discussing Recipes

Initially tought of making a tinder-esque recipe sharibng app, but for the lack of time and some issues this is it's current form.

Here is my initial proposition:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ayxvvNkaKH9x4EhpN0Rh3d84nRhfSJw0eXUEhCPAe-A/edit?usp=sharing

This app uses React js on the front-end, Express js in the back-end and MongoDB as a DB.

I finally also decided to do my own user creation and used bcryptjs for password encryption.

I tried to limit my use of packages as we were supposed to build things from the ground up.


## How to use it

Users are first dropped to the landing page:

![Cthuwu landing page](./assets/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-17%20at%2010.09.49%20AM.png)

They then can log-in or sign-up by either going to the menu on the top left or the sign-in button on the top right.
