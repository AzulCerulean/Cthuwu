## About

This is my final project submission for the Concordia full-stack web-dev bootcamp.

Recipe sharing web-app.

Users are able to sign-up and post recipes on the feed.
Social media for sharing, discovering and discussing Recipes

Initially tought of making a tinder-esque recipe sharing app, but for the lack of time and some issues this is it's current form.
Ended up being a social media for sharing recipes.

Here is my initial proposition:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ayxvvNkaKH9x4EhpN0Rh3d84nRhfSJw0eXUEhCPAe-A/edit?usp=sharing

This app uses React js on the front-end, Express js in the back-end and MongoDB as a DB.

There were a few issues with trying to make Auth0 to work with MongoDB, including a needed subscription.
I finally settled to do my own user creation and used bcryptjs for password encryption, and a context for keeping the loggedin user data.
It's currently working, but I would probably need to use a JWT for users for better security.

I tried to limit my use of packages as we were supposed to build things from the ground up.


## How to use it

Users are first dropped to the landing page:

You can also nagivigate to the Homepage by clicking on the logo on top or through the sidebar and that should lead a person to the Home feed.

Once Signed-in a user can then create a new recipe when opening the sidebar

It leads to the recipe creation page

![Cthuwu create new recipe](./assets/cthuwu%20new%20recipe.PNG)
![Cthuwu new recipe submitted](./assets/cthuwu%20new%20recipe.PNG)

This too creates a new object in MongoDB

The user that created the recipe has some options on on the recipe, they can update it or delete it from here.

When updating they can update any field in the recipe card, and delete will delete the recipe forever.
